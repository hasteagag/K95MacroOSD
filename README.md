Windows and Z keys make Corsair's K95 macro board appear at the top left of screen.  Attempts to read current hwnd, reactivate that window, and send Keys pre programmed elsewhere corresponding to the K 1 - 18 keys.

Not affiliated with Corsair in any way, just a fan and love the K95 and use this when I am using my K63.  The keys that each press emits must be registered in something like autohotkey.  Example code provided in hotkeyTest.ahk herein.  Thanks!
