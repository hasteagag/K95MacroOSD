Windows and Y keys make Corsair's K95 keyboard and the scimitar M keys appear at the top left of screen.  Attempts to read current hwnd, reactivate that window, and send Keys according to the associative arrays towards the end of y4.ahk.

Not affiliated with Corsair in any way, just a fan and love the K95 and use this when I am using my K63 to not lose the functionality of off board keys.  The keys that each OSK press emits must be registered in something like autohotkey.  Example code provided in hotkeyTest.ahk herein.

www.smithany.com/PURGED.psd has the basic layout cropped to vector masks, using export menu and CSS generation followed by Regex substitutions, we basically generated the contents of y4.ahk.
